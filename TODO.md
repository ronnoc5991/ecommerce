# TODO

- change category 'name' to 'slug'? don't display IT, display a string associated with it
- need to make sure that the category names are 'normalized' as either all caps or all lowercase, and maybe separated with dashes?

- add client to docker compose
- create a PLP
- create a PDP

- paginate the products? (this can come later, when there are a lot of products)

- add admin flow (authentication, authorization)
- Create admin flow:
- allow for product creation
- allow for variant creation
- allow for category creation

- add filtering to GET routes (GET products?audience=men&category=shirts)
