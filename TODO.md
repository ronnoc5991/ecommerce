# TODO

- refactor to allow for shared directory
- update docker images
- update mounts in docker compose
- use workspaces like AI suggests
- test that things work (images build, compose works, etc)

- change category 'name' to 'slug'? don't display IT, display a string associated with it
- need to make sure that the category names are 'normalized' as either all caps or all lowercase, and maybe separated with dashes?

- add admin flow (authentication, authorization)
- Create admin flow:
- allow for product creation
- allow for variant creation
- allow for category creation

- add filtering to GET routes (GET products?audience=men&category=shirts)

- should I have a client function for each server endpoint?
- then I could type out the arguments... and the return type
